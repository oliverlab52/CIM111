		<h1>How to Play the 3 Basic Chords on Guitar</h1>
	</u>

		<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>We will start with the basics. We will use the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 to represent your index, middle, ring, and pinkie fingers, respectively. Next, giving the strings some letters. The string names from thick to thin strings are E, A, D, G, B, and E. Another key point is the term "fret". A fret is each block you see on your guitar neck. Most guitar necks have dots marking the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and so on. With these three chords you will already be able to play through a lot of songs.</p>
